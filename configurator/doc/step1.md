title: Step 1. Fully automatic IP address assignment
tutorial: Configurator
---

## Goals

In the first step, we want to automatically assign addresses in a wired network.
To make the task a little bit more complicated, the network won't be a single LAN
but several LANs connected via routers. We want to place nodes on each subnet
into a different subnet, but otherwise we don't care how addresses are assigned.
We also ignore the question of filling routing tables for now -- it will be 
covered in later steps.

## The network

The network we want to configure is `ConfiguratorA`, defined in 
<a srcfile="configurator/ConfiguratorA.ned"/>. It looks like this:

The network contains three routers, each connected to the other two. There 
are three subnetworks with `StandardHosts`, connected to the routers by Ethernet 
switches. It also contains an instance of `IPv4NetworkConfigurator`.

## The configuration

In many scenarios, including this one, the `IPv4NetworkConfigurator`
module can properly configure the network using just the default settings. 
Thus, the configuration in omnetpp.ini for this step is basically empty:

<p><pre class="snippet" src="../omnetpp.uncommented.ini" from="Step1" until="####"></pre></p>

The configurator has several parameters that affect its operation, but for now,
all of them are left at their default settings. Let's briefly review the ones 
pertaining to IP address assignment:

- `assignAddresses = default(true)` controls whether the configurator should
  perform auto address assignment, i.e. assign IP addresses to interfaces.
  Details can be specified in the XML configuration.

- `assignDisjunctSubnetAddresses = default(true)` controls whether the configurator
  should assign different address prefixes and netmasks to nodes on different links. 
  (Nodes are considered to be on the same link if they can reach each other directly, 
  or through L2 devices only.)

An XML configuration can be supplied with the `config` parameter. When the user doesn't 
specify an XML configuration (such as in this step), the configurator uses the 
following default:

`config = default(xml("<config><interface hosts='**' address='10.x.x.x' netmask='255.x.x.x'/></config>"))`

It tells the configurator to assign IP addresses to all interfaces of all hosts,
from the address range 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 and netmask range 255.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255.


## Setting up logging and visualization

The configurator has several boolean parameters named `dump...`, which cause
it to dump certain parts of the configuration information into the module log. 
The one that corresponds to assigned IP addresses is called `dumpAddresses`.
These parameters are false by default, but we set them to true in the 
`General` section of omnetpp.ini to facilitate experimenting with
the configurator.

Network interface information, such as interface names and IP addresses,
can be visualized using the `InterfaceTableCanvasVisualizer` module, which
is already included in the network as a submodule of `IntegratedCanvasVisualizer`.
We also turn on interface visualization, but tell the visualizer to ignore 
switches and access points, as they don't have IP addresses.

Other settings in the `General` section, such as the WiFi bit rate,
are not relevant for the topic of the tutorial.

## Results

The IP addresses assigned to interfaces by the configurator are shown on the image below.
The switches and hosts connected to the individual routers are considered to be on the same link.
Note that the configurator assigned addresses sequentially starting from 10.0.0.1,
while making sure that different subnets got different address prefixes and netmasks,
as instructed by the `assignDisjunctSubnetAddresses` parameter.

Note that the configurator assigned a 29-bit netmask to the hosts and the router 
interfaces connecting to the switches, and a 30-bit netmask to the other router interfaces.
Three hosts and the router's interface towards a switch as a group has four interfaces,
thus, a 30-bit netmask with a 2-bit host identifier would have sufficed. However, 
the configurator doesn't assign addresses where the host identifier is all-zeros 
or all-ones (as they are commonly refer to the subnet itself and to the subnet 
broadcast address.)
